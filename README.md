## TopoJSON Tile Maker

Node web services and example front end to convert a collection of ESRI shapefiles into a complete administrative geography; e.g USA, states, counties, census tracts, census block groups into TopoJSON tiles optimised for a series to map zoomlevels. Typically zoomlevels 6-11 are supported. The web services contain a very simple tile server for testing; the user then dowmnloads the tiles for deploying a OSM 'standard' style compliant map server.
